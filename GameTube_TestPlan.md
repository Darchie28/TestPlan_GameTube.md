1 Intro:
 - Test Plan Objective: In my free time whenever I want to relax I like to play video games and view Twitch streams.
 - I had an idea to create an app that uses the Twitch API to get data about the most popular games and streamers.
 - The app is called GameTube
 - I need to test the app for visual and functional bugs.

- The main areas to focus on are the Home Page, and the Results (page after entering a game).
- Report any visual or functional bugs

- Search for any game thatâ€™s viewable in the current Twitch library. 
4 Resources:
- QA Engineer Denzel Archie.
- Repo is open to the public for testing 
5 Schedule:
- Testing starts 10/31/2025
6 Test Environment:
